### Hi there 👋 

- 🔭 Currently working on an exciting product called **Realmon Go**, designed to help people discover their non-human neighbours, like animals 🦥, birds 🐦, and plants 🍀 in the real world.
  - Hopefully, it’ll be as fun as Pokémon Go! 🥰
  - 🛠️ Tech stack: **React Native**, **Spring Boot/Java**, **MySQL**, **Docker**, and **AWS**.
  - 🚀 Planning to launch this year and attract a large user base!

- 💻 Other fun projects:
  - **DET-Quick**: A platform that helps users prepare for the Duolingo English Test, supporting 14+ question types.  
    Built with **React** and **Spring Boot/Java** as a **full-stack developer**.  
    Try it here 👉 [https://www.detquick.com](https://www.detquick.com)
    
  - **Sky-Takeout**: A takeout ordering system with both client and management interfaces built with **Java**.

- 💬 Ask me about **User Growth** and 🏝️ **FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)**!  
  - I know how to grow users fast via social media, and I also run a blog on early retirement with thousands of followers.

- 🥰 Reach out to me if you're a **hot nerd** 🤓.
  - Wouldn't mind having a **boyfriend** to build interesting products together.
  - Of course, you could also reach out as a **recruiter** 🤣.
